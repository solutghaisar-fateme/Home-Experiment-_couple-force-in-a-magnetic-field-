Home experiment_couple force in a magnetic field 


 Materials Used:

Two 15 cm copper wires

One 50 cm copper wire

A strong magnet (preferably neodymium)

1.5 V battery

Tape or connectors


Objective:

To visualize and understand the couple of forces acting on a current-carrying coil in a magnetic field and observe the resulting rotational torque.


Notes:

Approximate values and estimations were used in the measurements and calculations.
